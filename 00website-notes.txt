This site is built with Jekell

All files in docs/ become part of the website.
The subdirectories are (mostly) automagically built by Jekell.

For a local debug copy:
 you need to install jekell and bundler - see https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/
 and https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll

The config file is in docs/_config.yml
The site source is docs/
Jekyll builds into docs/_site

push to github deploys.

 From docs/
 use  LANG=en_US.UTF-8 bundle exec jekyll serve
 The site can be browsed on http://localhost:4000

To create a page, just add an .md file.

Make all links relative.

The site uses the time-machine theme.  GitHub variables are superseded in _config.yml

I create favicons with https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/
