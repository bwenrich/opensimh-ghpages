# Communicating with the [Open SIMH](/) project

---

The Open SIMH project is based on the work of a large community. There are
several ways to communicate with the community at large, as well as with
the leadership.

## Community e-mail list

The e-mail list is the communications vehicle used most often. It encompases
use of the simulators, development, and occaisional forrays into the history
of the systems and software that we emulate and support.

- Subscribe by sending an e-mail to [simh+subscribe@groups.io](mailto:simh+subscribe@groups.io)
- Unsubscribe by sending an e-mail to [simh+unsubscribe@groups.io](mailto:simh+unsubscribe@groups.io)
- Post by sending an e-mail to [simh@groups.io](mailto:simh@groups.io)
- The recent (2020+) archive is available on the web at
  [https://groups.io/g/simh/topics](https://groups.io/g/simh/topics)
- The older (2003-2020) archive is at
  [http://mailman.trailing-edge.com/pipermail/simh/](http://mailman.trailing-edge.com/pipermail/simh/)
  - Search this archive with Google using the
    `site:mailman.trailing-edge.com/pipermail/simh` qualifier

## Bug reports, feature requests, and code

Formal bug reports, feature requests, and code review are handled on the web
using GitHub "issuses".

- [GitHub issues for the simulators](https://github.com/{{site.simh_username}}/{{site.simh_reponame}}/issues)
- [GitHub issues for the simulation tools](https://github.com/{{site.simh_username}}/{{site.simtools_reponame}}/issues)
- [Mailing list issues by e-mail](mailto:simh+owner@groups.io)

## Code contributions

If you have code that you'd like to contribute, fork the appropriate repository,
make your changes, and submit a pull request. Discussion will be in
the pull request.

If you would like to discuss a potential contribution before it's coded (which is
wise for larger efforts), please open a GitHub issue.

## Steering Group

The Steering Group has ultimate responsibility for the project. We work with
the community for a concensus resolution of most issues. In general, we
prefer to discuss matters in one of the public formum. However, for
sensitive issues, the following e-mail addresses are available:

- [The Steering Group Members](mailto:sg@opensimh.org)
- [Administrative and/or technical issues](mailto:admin@opensimh.org)

The Steering Group consists of: Clem Cole, Richard Cornwell, Paul Koning,
Timothe Litt, Seth Morabito, and Bob Supnik

### PGP public keys

Some Steering Group members may digitally certify Open SIMH project PGP keys with a personal key.

To provide a chain of trust for the project keys, the keys that may be used for this are:

- [2A5B AD87 D03D 9599 9355  D615 3C4D EA25 9EAC C2B3](/sg_gpg_pubkey_cole.asc) (Clement T Cole)
- [30E5 BFA1 A5E0 7EDE BDCB  5934 4779 39B6 0719 18BF](/sg_gpg_pubkey_litt.asc) (Timothe Litt)

Although the project keys are expected to be stable, you may prefer to verify them with
the Steerng Group member's key.
